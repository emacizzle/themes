		<h1>EcoApprentice</h1>

		<p><strong>EcoApprentice</strong> is an innovative online resource where schools and local businesses<br/>connect to develop ecologically-friendly solutions to everyday problems.</p>

		<p><strong>EcoApprentice</strong> is both a compass and a meeting place where employers and<br/>students learn from each other. Many of today’s businesses are seeking to employ<br/>individuals skilled in green trades and sustainable work practices. At the same <br/>time, students at all levels are eager to learn how to make their communities<br/>cleaner and more energy efficient by helping eco-responsible enterprises.</p>

		<p><strong>EcoApprentice for Employers:</strong> You post questions related to eco-challenges at your<br/>workplace; students respond by researching eco-friendly solutions. In the process, your<br/>business is advertised in a proactive way while the students gain real life problem-solving<br/>experience. Together, you build a sense of community, rewarding for everyone involved.</p>

		<p><strong>EcoApprentice for Educators:</strong> You have one-stop access to a comprehensive list of businesses that want to collaborate with students in solving their particular environmental challenges. These links have the potential of opening doors to internship placements for work-based credits, solution-focused field trips, classroom presentations, and special project collaborations.</p>

		<p><strong>EcoApprentice</strong> is a continually growing resource. Here, you will have immediate access to post, view, and learn from the results of students and businesses working together to answer today’s eco-challenges.</p>
