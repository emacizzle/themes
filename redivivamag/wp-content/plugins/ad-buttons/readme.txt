== Description ==
The Ad Buttons plugin displays a number of graphical ads in a sidebar widget

The current version contains the following functionality:

Add new ad buttons:

Enable/disable individual ad buttons:
Each ad button can be enabled or disabled from the admin panel

Select how many ad buttons to display in the sidebar widget.
Displaying the ad buttons on your blog is done by randomly selecting ads from your total list of active ads. You can select how many ads are displayed on your blog.

See how many times each ad button has been displayed and clicked.
Ad performance is an important measurement, especially when your ads link to affiliate programs. The number of views, clicks and CTR (click thru rate) are displayed for each ad button. Views by search engine bots are automatically filtered from the count.

A Google AdSense 125 x 125 ad unit can be displayed by filling in your AdSense publisher ID. AdSense ad colors can be controlled right from the Ad Buttons admin panel.

Ads can be scheduled by specifying a start and end date

new in release 1.7: geo targeting - show ads depending on the location of your visitors



== Installation ==

To install this plugin unzip the downloaded file and upload the entire ad buttons folder to your blogs plugin folder ( \wp-content\plugins\ ) the plugin should now show up in the WordPress plugins panel, available for activation.
